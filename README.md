# Predicting-Profitability-and-Customer-Preferences
In this course, you will continue to work with Danielle Sherman, the Chief Technology Officer at Blackwell Electronics. Blackwell Electronics is a successful consumer electronics retailer with both bricks & mortar stores in the southeastern United States and an eCommerce site. They have recently begun to leverage the data collected from online and in-store transactions to gain insight into their customers' purchasing behavior. Your job is to extend their application of data mining methods to develop predictive models and you'll be using both Weka and R to accomplish this. In this course, you will use machine learning methods to predict which potential new products that the sales team is considering adding to Blackwell's current product mix will be the most profitable.  Next, you will create a model to predict which brand of computer products Blackwell customers prefer based on customer demographics collected from a marketing survey. Finally, you will present to management, explaining your insights and suggestions for data mining process improvements.
